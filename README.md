## Implementation

   Command endpoint takes the files list as arguments and fix the formatting. All configurations can be modified.
  Each step code style can be defined independently based on keywords (`And`, `Then`, `Scenario` etc).

### Code style
- All step keywords and tables (_symbol_:`|`) are right-aligned (_Except_ `Scenario`, `Feature`, `Background` _and_ `Examples`).
- All extra spaces inside table cells are deleted
- Table column width is determined by the longest cell in that column.

### Usage:
  
    gherkin-fixer /path/to/test1.feature /path/to/test2.feature ...

### Setting up the project for development:

You will also want to ensure that `./bin` & `./vendor/bin` is in your `$PATH` and is the highest priority. `./node_modules/.bin` should be included in you `$PATH` at the lowest priority. You can do so by adding the following to your shell profile:

    export PATH=./bin:./vendor/bin:$PATH:./node_modules/.bin

Run `init_project`. This will install the project dependencies

### Building the image

Run `docker_build`. This will create a local docker image called `medology/gherkin-cs-fixer:$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')` that you can use for testing

### Testing

This project has PHPUnit testing. To run tests run `phpunit`

### Dependencies
- PHP >= 7.1.0
